# HTML_CSS_Refactor
Challenge 1 - To refactor an existing webpage to make it accessible and to improve SEO.

This version of Heriseon's website has been refracted to meet accessibility standards. Some updates include adding semmantic elements so that the code is easier to understand. Reduce redundancy by consolidating classes that do the same thing in css into one class applied to each section. Comments were added to provide further information on what each section of code is responsible for displaying. Class and ID names were change to be more relevant to information and title was also for clarity. Alt text were added to the images used in the content section but not added for the benefits section since not as needed.
